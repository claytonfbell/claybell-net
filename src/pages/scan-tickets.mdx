# Scan Tickets

These products were developeed several years ago for our Interactive Ticketing clients to scan tickets at their venues.

Since we primary service consumer shows and fairs that fill in thousands of visitors by the hour, it needs to perform well in conditions where access to internet or wired electrical outlets are difficult.

It has some advanced settings configured online that push down to the devices.

It is currently on its 6th major version, I'm considering a version 7 with Electron and/or React Native.

## iOS version

The iOS version is primarily for iPods that are inserted into [barcode scanner accessory](https://ipcmobile.com/devices/linea-pro-5) that encases the iPod.
